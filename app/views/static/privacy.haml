<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<span>When you share information with us, for example by creating an account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant information and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</span>
<p>
<span>Our Privacy Policy explains:</span>
</p>
<ol start='1'>
<li>
<span>What information we collect and why we collect it.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>How we use that information.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<span>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible. Your privacy matters to us, but if you have any questions, please contact us.</span>
</p>
<h3>
<span>Information that we collect</span>
</h3>
<p>
<span>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from basics, such as which language you speak to more complex things, such as which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>We collect information in two ways:</span>
</p>
<ol start='1'>
<li>
<span>Information that you give us.</span>
<span> For example, many of our services require you to sign up for an account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, such as your name, email address, telephone number or credit card number. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features that we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible profile, which may include your name and photo.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Information that we get from your use of our services.</span>
<span> We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, such as when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</span>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class='c13' start='1'>
<span>Device information</span>
<li>
<span>We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information, including phone number). We may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your account.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<span>Log information. When you use our services or view content provided by us, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:</span>
<ol start='1'>
<li>
<span>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>telephony log information, such as your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Internet protocol address.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>device event information, such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class='c13' start='5'>
<span>Location information</span>
<li>
<span>When you use a location-enabled service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and mobile towers.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Unique application numbers</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to us when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<span>Local storage</span>
<li>
<span>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device, using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<span>Cookies and anonymous identifiers</span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our service, which may include one or more cokkies or anonynous identifiers sent to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services that we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or other features that may appear on other sites.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>
<span>How we use information that we collect</span>
</h3>
<p>
<span>We use the information that we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones and to protect us and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – such as giving you more relevant search results and ads.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>We may use the name that you provide for your profile across all of the services we offer that require an account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your account, so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible profile information, such as your name and photo.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>When you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication to help resolve any issues that you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to provide you our services in your preferred language. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other services – for example, to make it easier to share things with people you know.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those set out in this Privacy Policy.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>We process personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.</span>
</p>
<h3>
<span>Information that you share</span>
</h3>
<p>
<span>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options for sharing and removing your content.</span>
</p>
<h3>
<span>Accessing and updating your personal information</span>
</h3>
<p>
<span>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so free of charge, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</span>
</p>

<span>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</span>
</p>
<h3>
<span>Information security</span>

</li>
<li>
<span>We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. They may be disciplined or their contract terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</span>
